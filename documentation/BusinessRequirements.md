# Business Requirements

The idea behind these business requirements is that they will change with time. What I hope to accomplish is to build
up with each version. As a start I will be building an MVP with the bare minimum in my opinion. As part of the requirements
for each version I will also add a roadmap what I hope to have ready for the next version and why it makes sense.

## V20.1 - MVP

The goal for this release is to have the top 20-30 companies selected by Joel Greenblatt's 
magic formula.

* User Story 1: 
    > I enter an URL in my browser and I receive information about the top 30 companies selected by Joel Greenblatt's 
formula at the current time. 
* User Story 2:
    > I enter an URL in my browser and I am sure I have the latest company tickers from the NYSE

For the next releases we would want:
1. Selecting stocks and notifications for rebalancing the portfolio
2. Retrospective of how the selected stocks have performed back in time
3. Performance measurement of the portfolio against S&P500/other benchmark
